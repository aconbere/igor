_template: "main.html" # defaults to main.html
published_on: "2009-01-11" # defaults to the date added to the repository
last_modified: "2009-01-11" # defaults to the date last modified
slug: "this_is_the_example" # defaults to the slugified title
title: "will default to the title text" # defaults to the first line of content

The first line is title text

After that the rest is the content text. Content areas should be able to hanlde images as well as other media items inserted into the text area.

Any further newlines are converted to paragraphs

Other than that no further manipulation of the text beyond raw html will be done.
